<img src='https://i.imgur.com/UtQ8Vd2.png' alt='Noclip Logo' width=64px>

**Requirements:**
- You **must** have access to the social tab of the forum dashboard.
- You **must** have a Steam group; you can create one [here](https://steamcommunity.com/actions/GroupCreate)

## Getting your group ID

Steam group ID's have two forms, the 32-bit ID and the 64-bit ID.

You can find the 32-bit ID on your group's dashboard which is accesible via the `Edit Group Profile` button.

Retrieving the 64-bit ID is a bit more complicated, in an effort to save time Noclip has created a very simple tool to do fetch it for you.
You can access it [here](https://steam-group-id.vercel.app); simply paste your group's URL slug and click the `submit` button. (it can take a few seconds to fetch the ID)

## Setting up the widget

Log into your forum dashboard and go to the `Settings` tab, from there navigate to the `Social` tab.

Put either the 32-bit or 64-bit ID in the `Steam Group ID` field and click `Update Steam Group`.

## Final product

If you have done everything correctly, on the front of your forum page there should be a widget on the right hand side showing the members and description of your group, along side a link to your Steam group.
