## Vanity Domain

Vanity domains allow you to use your own domain name for your forum.
<br>
https://official.noclip.me is something like what Noclip provides for free however, upgrading to the [Rainbow](https://noclip.me/upgrade) or [Partner](https://noclip.me/partners) package allows you to use your own domain name; you'd be able to access your forums at [https://mydarkrpforums.com/]() or something similar.

**You can read how to do that [here](Domain.md).**

## Steam Group

You can feature your Steam group on your forum.
This will add a widget to your forum that will show your group's members and a join link.

**You can read how to do that [here](Steam%20Group.md).**

## Discord Invite

## Discord OAuth (sign in)

Does your community primarily use Discord or would you like to allow users to log in with Discord. Noclip allows users to log into the forums with Discord if you have enabled and configured it.

**You can read how to do that [here](Discord%20OAuth.md).**

## Store Linking

Using Noclip's donation store? Not sure on how to link it? Then you have came to the right place.
This will allow your noclip store to grant users within your community packages in-game automatically.

**You can read how to do that [here](Store%20Linking.md).**
