## Vanity Domain

Vanity domains allow you to use your own domain name for your forum.
<br>
https://official.noclip.me is something like what Noclip provides for free however, upgrading to the [Rainbow](https://noclip.me/upgrade) or [Partner](https://noclip.me/partners) package allows you to use your own domain name; you'd be able to access your forums at [https://mydarkrpforums.com/]() or something similar.

**You can read how to do that [here](Domain.md).**

## Steam Group

You can feature your Steam group on your forum.
This will add a widget to your forum that will show your group's members and a join link.

**You can read how to do that [here](Steam%20Group.md).**
